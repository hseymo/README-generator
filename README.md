### **Description**
---
The motivation for this project was to create a tool that assists in the standardized process of writing code and creating repositories. A high quality README file is an integral part of any good project as it is the first thing anyone will see when they visit your repository. This, this project provides a tool to use for this. It solves the problem of wondering what to include in your README file each time, by prompting the user with specific questions. From creating this program I learned how to utilize node.js, use packages such as inquire and fs, to prompt the user and read/write files, respectively.  <br><br>
This project is not deployed. <br><br>

### **Usage** 
---
To use this program, open the "index.js" file in your integrated terminal. Run the command "node index.js" and the prompted questions will begin. If you don't have a good answer to a question yet - don't worry! You can add directly to the Markdown file later. It will produce a new file in the 'dist' folder. Copy or move this file into the program it is intended for!  <br>
